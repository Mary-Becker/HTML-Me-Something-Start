               <h2>5. American Horror Story</h2>
                  <p>For any person who enjoys horror, there is bound to be a few seasons of this show that they love. I say this because they tell different stories through each season. I love this because it gives the audience a chance to enjoy vastly different settings and stories, my personal favorites being "Coven" for that witchy aesthtic and "1984" for more of a slasher thrill.
                     It also give us another chance to see our favorite actors on screen again, if they got killed off in the last season. With this, some seasons are going to be stronger than others that will vary for everyone. Even then, each season's production and cinematography is always to the max. </p>

               <h2>3. Brooklyn Nine-Nine</h2>
                  <p>This hillarious sitcom follows 7 NYPD detectives as they are adjusting to their work life under their new commanding officer, the stern Captain Raymond Holt. This is the type of show anyone could throw on and immediatley get swept into the drama, the romance, and the fun antics that are always happening. My personal favorite part about this 
                     show is that episodes aren't restricted to the same locatoins like most sitcoms are. It allows more fun and silly moments to take place at work together, but once they step out of the building, they know to give the audience some more action and drama. </p>

               <h2>4. Ted Lasso</h2>
                   <p>An amazing sports comedy follows an American collage football coach named Ted Lasso as he is moves to Richmond, England to coach a the city's soccer team. Whose owner is secretly hoping his inexperience will lead to the teams downfall? This is one of the few shows that has successfully pulled my attention in episode one
                     and had me head over heels with the characters. The best part is because they are all so different and complex. They do a good job not to forget side characters and I love that they can put any random characters together an they are going to to have a funny dynamic. </p>

               <h2>2. One Piece</h2>
                  <p>Prepare to cast off and never look back because once you start this show, there is never going back.This modern day Odyssey with 1000+ episodes and 12 hundred characters is about a world within a pirate age. Started by the previous pirate king minutes before his execution, Gold D. Roger, told the masses that his great tresure is waiting for them on the high seas.
                     What is his great tresure? All he says before dying is "Wealth, fame, and power. I've discovered everything the world coud offer, and it's all together in one place, in one piece." We follow our main character 'Monkey D. Luffey', as he sails to find the one piece and becme the next king of the pirates. This is a rich universe is filled to the brim of different stories, struggles, and dreams.
                     this would be my number one, but I haven't finished it yet, and the story is still on going, but I have no doubt that it will be brilliant.

               <h2> 1. AVATAR</h2>
                  <h3>THE LAST AIRBENDER</h3>
                      <p id = "testP" class="funParagraph" >This nickeloadeon show changed the game with it's increadible pacing, world building, and one of the best magical systems I've ever seen written into a show. It follows avatar Aang, as he is on a journey to learn how to bend all the elements, so he will be able to stop the 100 year war.As much of an easy watch it also trusts it's younger audience(at the time) with some incredible heavy subjects like, genocide, nationalist propaganda,
                        and abusive relationships just to name a few, but did so with grace. The characters feel real because their strengths coincides with their weaknesses. The audiemce can understand any character's actions make sense to the viewers because they do such a good job at showing us who these chaacters are and what they've been through. With it's resolution being so satisfying and because they built the world so well. They are able to 
                         expand the universe with it follow-up series "Avatar: The Legend of Korra" </p>
